// LinearVest is a contract that releases tokens to a recipient linearly over a specified period.
// For example, if 100 tokens are vested over 100 days, the recipient will receive 1 token per day.
// However, the vesting happens every second, so every update to the block.timestamp means the amount
// withdrawable is updated. The contract should track the amount of tokens the user has withdrawn so far.
// For example, if the vesting period is 4 hours, then after 1 hour, 1/4th of the tokens are withdrawable.

// Be careful to track the amount withdrawn per-vesting. The same user might have multiple vestings using
// the same token.

// Lifecycle:
// Sender deposits tokens into the contracts and creates a vest
// Receiver can withdraw their tokens at any time, but only up to the amount released
// The receiver can identify vests that belong to them by scanning for events that contain
// their address as the recipient
