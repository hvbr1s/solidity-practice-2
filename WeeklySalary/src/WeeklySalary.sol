// specification
// - the contract is used to pay contractors weekly
// - a contractor can withdraw a fixed salary every week
// - if they do not withdraw for more than a week, they also withdraw undrawn salary
// - Example: less than 1 week withdraw: 0 salary
// -          more than 1 week withdraw, but less than 2 weeks: 1 week salary
// -          more than 2 weeks withdraw, but less than 3 weeks: 2 weeks salary
// -          etc.
// - if a contractor is deleted, they cannot withdraw anymore
// - no partial payments, if the contract doesn't have enough balance, the function will revert
// - with InsufficientBalance()
